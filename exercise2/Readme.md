Exercise 2
==========

Solution for Task 2.4 is solved with Jupyter Notebook. It's possible to set up a runtime environment with Pipenv and run it from there:

```.sh
pip install pipenv  # only if pipenv isn't installed
pipenv install
pipenv run jupyter
```

Then open `localhost:8888` from a web browser and select the exercise notebook.
